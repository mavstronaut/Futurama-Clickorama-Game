# Clicky-Game

Built on react, deployed to Github Pages

## Demo 
[example solution](https://clicky-game.netlify.com/) and study the app's basic functionality.

### Instructions

1. The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

2. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

5. When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.

#### Hints

* Begin by building a non-functioning static version for your Clicky Game. Then work on making the game interactive.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
